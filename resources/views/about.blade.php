	<h4>How did I get here?</h4>
	<img src="img/myface/baby.jpg" class="img-responsive img-circle pull-left">
	<p>
		In the late eighties, I was a baby who didn't know anything. I had a lot to learn, 
		which was really fortunate for me, since learning is definitely my favorite thing. 
	</p>
	<p>
		By the late aughts, I was a much taller baby who had learned a lot of things. 
		<img src="img/myface/explorer.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive pull-right">I 
		had ecstatically geeked out at Boston University, where I developed strong analytical 
		skills studying the most productive, recursive and powerful tool humanity has: language! 
		I knew how to read speech sounds from a spectrogram, diagram complex grammar into syntax 
		trees, distinguish an allophone from a phoneme, and identify which of Grice's maxims an 
		awkward person had just violated, among other things. 
		I understood that the best way to learn a language was to immerse yourself in it after 
		a semester abroad.
	</p>
	<p>
		Years of customer service fulfilled my need to help others, but left me needing
		more creative outlets.
		My affinity for language systems and love of learning drew me to web technologies. 
		In the tech world, there's always something new to learn. 
		(Heck, I just had to re-learn Laravel's newest version to build this site!)
		I found that a linguistics B.A. 
		had provided a solid foundation in problem-solving that translated well to programming.
