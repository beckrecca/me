	<h4>Right Now</h4>

	<p>
		Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Liberal Arts (ALM) at Harvard Extension School.
		I am concentrating in Information Technology with a major in Digital Media Arts and
		Instructional Design. I am passionate about my studies, and I dream of working
		in tech someday. 
	</p>

	<h4>How did I get here?</h4>
	<p>
		In the late eighties, I was a baby who didn't know anything. I had a lot to learn, 
		which was really fortunate for me, since learning is definitely my favorite thing. 
	</p>
	<p>
		By the late aughts, I was a much taller baby who had learned a lot of things. I 
		had ecstatically geeked out at Boston University, where I developed strong analytical 
		skills studying the most productive, recursive and powerful tool humanity has: language! 
		I knew how to read speech sounds from a spectrogram, diagram complex grammar into syntax 
		trees, distinguish an allophone from a phoneme, and identify which of Grice's maxims an 
		awkward person had just violated, among other things. I understood that the best way to 
		learn a language was to immerse yourself in it after a semester abroad.
	</p>
	<p>
		My affinity for creative systems and love of learning drew me to web technologies. 
		In the tech world, there's always something new to learn. 
		(Heck, I just had to re-learn Laravel's newest version to build this site!)
		I found that a linguistics B.A. 
		had provided a solid foundation in problem-solving that translated well to programming.
